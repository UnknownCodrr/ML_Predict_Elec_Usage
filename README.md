-- Dataset --

The dataset used is a public dataset (recs2015_public_v4.csv), which contains various features related to electricity consumption. Make sure to set your own file path before running the script.

Key columns:

ELECTRICITY_USAGE (Target variable)
Categorical and numerical features related to households.
-- Features --

Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values and encodes categorical features using LabelEncoder.
Scaling: Standardizes the feature set using StandardScaler.
Model Training:

Implements a Random Forest Regressor for prediction.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Uses GridSearchCV for finding optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluation:

Assesses model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
Visualization:

Plots actual vs. predicted electricity usage.
-- Technologies Used --

Python
Pandas
NumPy (optional)
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Joblib
-- Installation --

Clone this repository:

bash git clone (link unavailable) cd electricity-usage-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

bash pip install -r requirements.txt

Place your dataset in the appropriate directory and update the file_path variable in the script:

file_path = 'path_to_your_dataset/recs2015_public_v4.csv'

-- Usage --

Run the script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:

bash python (link unavailable)

-- Model Training and Evaluation --

Training:

The Random Forest model is trained using an 80-20 train-test split.
Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)
The model is saved using joblib for future predictions.

-- Hyperparameter Tuning --

A grid search is performed to find the best parameters for the Random Forest model. The following hyperparameters are tuned:

n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest.
max_depth: Maximum depth of the tree.
min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split a node.
Run the hyperparameter tuning process using:

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2)

-- Visualization --

A scatter plot is generated to compare actual and predicted electricity usage. The red dashed line represents the ideal prediction line (y = x).

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) sns.scatterplot(x=y_test, y=y_pred, color='blue') plt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_test), max(y_test)], color='red', linestyle='--') plt.xlabel('Actual Electricity Usage') plt.ylabel('Predicted Electricity Usage') plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Electricity Usage') plt.show()

-- Results --

Best Model Performance:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): mse_best
R-squared (R²): r2_best
The model's performance improves after hyperparameter tuning.
